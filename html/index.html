                <h2>$100 million reasons!</h2>
                <p>For ages, proud men and women have fought for their Home, their Kin and their Country - it is time we
                    fight for our Us, our Planet, and our Future!</p>
                <p><span class="celeb">Leonardo Di Caprio</span>, <span class="celeb">Natalie Portman</span>, <span class="celeb">
                Woody Harrelson</span>, and many more, are already doing their bit for our environment! Will you
                    fight alongside them to help save our environment and our planet?
                    <span id="showDetails" onclick="showDetails()">Full briefing!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="details">For centuries past false leaders on our planet have claimed amongst others that The
                    Sun orbits our planet, The Earth is flat, subprime mortgages is the future and there
                    is no global warming - we have heard it all before, might they be wrong again?</p>
                <p class="details">Some right wing capitalists claim that there is no link between our style of life and
                    the obvious decline of our planet and they won't listen to reason!</p>
                <p class="details">We need your help to make the cries of the planet a top-tier political issue so
                    that they will drown out the monetary fog our current leaders exist in. We need your help to make
                    them listen to the facts our scientists tells us!</p>
                <p class="details">Recent studies carried out by some of the planets most intelligent scientists show
                    that we cannot keep polluting and tear down our planet the way we are now! At this rate our planet
                    will revolt against us within the proverbial blink of an eye.</p>
                <p class="details">Scientist say that this is the time to act! Take a stand! Help help save the
                    climate, our Earth the future home of all men, women and children!</p>
                <p class="details">After coaxing <span class="celeb">past hedgefund mogul and billionaire Tom Steyer
                    </span> to fund our cause, we have 100 million reasons why we will be successful at pushing
                    environment issues to the top-tier of American politics!</p>
                <p class="details">All we want is your support, to show that this is the power of the people! With your
                    help we will stop projects such as the Keystone XL Oil Pipeline, and the continued destruction of
                    our rainforests!</p>
                <p class="details">Support our cause to help raise 100 million reasons why we will be successful!
